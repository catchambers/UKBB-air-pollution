Definitions --------------------------------------------------------------
Prevalent cancers were those diagnosed prior to recruitment to the Biobank study.
Patients with prevalent cancers were filtered out of the lung cancer data set. CH status is not influenced by prior cancer status.

Clonal Hematopoiesis (CH)
Expansion of blood cells arising from mutant HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS often related to aging. Mutations on epigenetic regulator genes are common in clonal hematopoiesis and may be a risk factor for HEMATOLOGIC NEOPLASMS and other cardiovascular diseases. When variant allele fraction is at least 2% and is present in the absence of severe cytopenias it is referred to as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP).

Putative Driver (PD)
Known or hypothesized cancer putative drivers

Incident 
Incidence is limited to new cases only. Only cancers after baseline date when
participants entered the study are considered.

Methods ------------------------------------------------------------------
Study Design - Retrospective Case-Control

Study Population - UK Biobank Participants
  ~500,000 participants aged 40â€“69 years recruited between 2006 and 2010
  
Outcomes
  - Incident lung cancer (replicating results)
  - Incident clonal hematopoesis
  
Statistical Analyses
  - Cox proportional hazard
  - Estimate: Hazard Ratios
  - Time-on-study is the time-scale. Censor date included earliest of:
    death date, date of lung cancer diagnosis, date lost to followup, or date
    of last reported cancer registry data. 
    
  
Data Filtering -----------------------------------------------------------
Excluded individuals with prevalent cancer (either solid tumor or hematologic).

Only included unique participant ID rows after cancer registry data was incorporated and the data set was sorted by phenotype value and cancer date.

Lung Cancer Cases
4920 - From UKBB cancer registry data
4577 - After prior cancers removed (including skin cancers)
4292 - Cases where lung cancer diagnosis is after censor date were removed

Xiaoyu Zong in Dr. Yin Cao's lab processed an initial batch of lung cancer cases.
This data set consisted of approximately half of the UKBB cohort.
